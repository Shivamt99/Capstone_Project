## WHO LET THE DOG'S OUT?


# Objective

This project hopes to identify dog breeds from images. This is a fine-grained classification problem: all breeds of Canis lupus familiaris share similar body features and over-all structure, so differentiating between breeds is a difficult problem. Furthermore, there is low inter-breed and high intra-breed variation; in other words, there are relatively few differences between breeds and relatively large differences within breeds, differing in size, shape, and color.  In fact, dogs are both the most morphologically and genetically diverse species on Earth. The difficulties of identifying breeds because of diversity are compounded by the stylistic differences of photographs used in the dataset, which features dogs of the same breed in a variety of lightings and positions.
